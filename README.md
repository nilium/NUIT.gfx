## README

This is a collection of graphics for the NUI Toolkit, and in a sense
are the graphics that NUIT was written with in mind.  That being said,
NUIT is fairly flexible, and I've provided the PSDs for all controls
in the interest of ensuring that you have a reasonable idea of what
each control's graphical layout is like.

Further documentation will be available later with the specific
requirements for every control that uses images when drawing.
